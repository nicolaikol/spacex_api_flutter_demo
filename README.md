# SpaceX API Demo with Flutter

A simple demonstration of using Flutter to read SpaceX API's
- Loads a list of launches
- Views details of the launch / payload

## Design Decisions
- The brief asked me to use the SpaceX API [V3](https://docs.spacexdata.com/) API, however it's deprecated and that page recommends to use it's successor, [V4](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs#rspacex-api-docs). Therefore I adopted the latest.
